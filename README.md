 # Inspiration
I vividly remember sitting with my family at a coffee house celebrating my sister's birthday. She was recently granted promotion and our happiness knew no bounds. It was fun, but something was missing. She did not seem to enjoy herself to the fullest. When asked, "I have to send 3 files by tomorrow , but I just want some sleep" " You just got promoted, it should mean less work right?" , I asked. "Lol". Our mother also remarked how weak she was getting due to lack of exercise. "I don't have time", a classic response. "Dude, just look for another job". " I am already on it". Her response astonished me since she is a very valuable asset to her company, winning awards and all.

So to conclude, my sister felt no motivation to work and was compromising her health. As for the employer, he was about to lose an asset.

# What it does
Xeta- It is a all-in-one platform. It helps companies and businesses to reward their employees on their work, provide health benefits, allow them to share their ideas and feel valued and create a sense of harmony among their employees.

# How we built it
We built it through python flask framework and firebase primilarly. We also used OpenCV Mediapipe for posture recognition.

# How it works
For Employers: Our website allows employers or team lead to register, create project, add team, rate tasks and ideas, and issue gift cards as a reward. On completion of a successful task or project, employees can issue gift cards to certain employees according to their work performance. They would also be able to review ideas submitted by employees.

For Employees: Our platform will allow them to submit their tasks, projects as assigned by their team lead and ideas which they think will help grow the company. Also, they can ask their team lead to disburse gift cards to their colleagues.
